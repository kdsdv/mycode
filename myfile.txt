View the available built-in methods to use with the dir() function while in the Python shell. Methods can be described using the help() function.

1. Create a file-object called x that has the attributes of myfile.txt, in write-mode.
	>>> x = open("myfile.txt", "w")

2. Run dir() on the fileobject.
	>>> dir(x)

3. Read the help() page on the read() method.
	>>> help(x.read)

4. Press q to quit the help page. Notice some methods are surrounded by underscores? Those are built in methods.
